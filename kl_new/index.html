        <h3>A Rich Historical Heritage</h3>
        <p>Kuala Lumpur, meaning "muddy confluence" in Malay, was founded in 1857 at the meeting point of the Klang and Gombak rivers. What began as a small tin-mining settlement rapidly transformed into the thriving capital of Malaysia. The city's history is reflected in its diverse architecture, from colonial-era buildings like the Sultan Abdul Samad Building to the iconic Islamic-inspired design of the modern Railway Station.</p>
        <p>The city became the capital of the Federated Malay States in 1896 and has since evolved into a melting pot of Malay, Chinese, and Indian cultures. This multicultural heritage is evident in the city's festivals, cuisine, and daily life, making KL one of Southeast Asia's most culturally diverse capitals.</p>
